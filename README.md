# About this App
I made this application with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãapplying all my technological knowledge about React and its ecosystem with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping a first mobile application that is scalable and with good architectural design. üíªüë®‚Äçüíª

- Deployed App: [https://gerleven.github.io/CashOperations/#/list](https://gerleven.github.io/CashOperations/#/list)


## The repository includes:
- App (made in React + Vite).
- API, hosted at "./API" (made in Express)
- The Postman Collection, hosted at "./API/Postman Collection"

## How to Run Local:
- Clone the repository
- run **`npm install`** in the App and API directories
- run **`npm run dev`** in the App directory

## About how the application consumes the API:
- When run on Github Pages ([CashOperations](https://gerleven.github.io/CashOperations)) the App uses fake data.
- When run locally:
  - If the API is running, the app will consume it.
  - If not, the App will notify you and you can choose between running the API before continuing or just continuing but with hardcoded data.
